# Project Description
Memoria is your personal photo album where you can safely express yourself. With Memoria, you can upload personal
photos, put on filters, and write captions so that the memories will forever live on. Memoria also allows you to create
a slideshow from selected images. Be creative with your personal slideshow as you can play your favourite songs, add
visual effects, and write meaningful texts.

To keep your privacy safe, Memoria creates a database in your own machine, and stores your personal photos locally.
As a user, you will not have to worry about security as no personal data is shared online or with any third-party app.
